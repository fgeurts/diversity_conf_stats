    This page presents details that support our analysis that a problematically small number of speakers are asked to give conference talks too frequently with respect to other potential speakers in the field.  This and other concerns are based on an analysis of conference speaker
    statistics in the field of Relativisitic Heavy Ion physics. It is
    based on speakers listed on public websites from most major
    conferences in this field between 2011 and 2019.
&nbsp; The analysis
    was performed by members of the <a href="https://rhicuec.org">RHIC/AGS
      UEC</a> and others.&nbsp; &nbsp; For more information please
    contact the authors at <a href="mailto:%20rhic_conf@gmail.com">rhic_conference_stats_analysis_team@gmail.com</a>.&nbsp;

    <h2>Disproportionately Large Numbers of Talks Given by Small Numbers
      of Speakers</h2>
    A small fraction of speakers are responsible for a disproportionate
    number of talks.&nbsp; This is particularly dominant among female
    theorists.&nbsp; Pie Chart:
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    About 40% of talks are given by people with 3 or more talks.<br>

    -In the data anlaysis that follows we use as a reference the
    following expectations for the percent of&nbsp; femaile
    theorists,&nbsp; Theorists: 12.4% female&nbsp; Experimentalists:
    20.3% femaleâ€¦ this is based on XXX, YYY<br>
