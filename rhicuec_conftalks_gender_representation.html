    This page presents details that support our analysis that a major conferences in our field have problematically low fluctuations in representation of women in the field with respect to the demographic populations in our field. This conclusion is based on an analysis of conference speaker statistics in the field of Relativisitic Heavy Ion physics. It is based on speakers listed on public websites from most majorconferences in this field between 2011 and 2019.&nbsp; The analysis was performed by members of the <a href="https://rhicuec.org">RHIC/AGS
      UEC</a> and others.&nbsp; &nbsp; For more information please

    The fields of physics in general and nuclear physics has
    underrepresentation by women and minority much smaller than
    demographic fractions.&nbsp; [citation]&nbsp; Most in the community
    agree that steps should be taken to mitigate biases that contribute
    to the causes of underrepresentation and encourage the
    underepresented social identities to join and stay in the
    field.&nbsp; Research shows [citation stereotype threat, etc.] and
    experience of the RHIC Diversity Working group members&nbsp;
    anecdotally confirms that observing more role models in the
    field helps avoid negative feedback cycles that lead to further,
    worse underrepresentation.&nbsp; Talks at conferences are high
    profile situtations that&nbsp; conference organizers should
    therefore take steps to avoid unneccessary low fluctuations below
    the known fractions based on the demographic fractions of
    minorities.<br>
    <br>
    The results of Gender representation at major conferences has been
    uneven, with women frequently underrepresented among speakers <br>
    Women are less likely to get “vision” talks. No woman has ever given
    the QM summary. <br>
