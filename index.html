    This page presents highlights of an analysis of conference speaker
    statistics in the field of Relativisitic Heavy Ion physics. It is
    based on speakers listed on public websites from most major
    conferences in this field between 2011 and 2019.&nbsp; The analysis
    was performed by members of the <a href="https://rhicuec.org">RHIC/AGS
      UEC</a> and others.&nbsp; &nbsp; For more information please

    The study identified a number of issues outline in sections below,
    which may point to the need for conference organizers to apply more
    equitable methods of selecting speakers:<br>
    <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#cc0000"><b>-Small numbers of
          speakers give a disproportionately large number of talks</b></font>
      (click here)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#cc0000"><b>-Gender
          representation at major conferences often has problematic
          fluctuations, with women frequently underrepresented among
          speakers</b><b> </b></font>(click here)</big><br>
    <br>
    Based on these results we recommend conference organizers in our
    field use <a href="bestpractices_conf_speakers.html">best practices
    </a>linked here for avoiding these sorts of problems, such using a
    speaker candidate list that includes all members of the
    community.&nbsp; We are happy to provide such a list upon request by
    email to <a href="mailto:%20rhic_uec@gmail.com">rhic_uec@gmail.com</a>.&nbsp;

    In many places in the analysis we make reference to general
    demographics statistics such as the percentage of experimentalists
    that are female. <a href="Demographics_page">This page</a> contains
    information on these demographics estimations. &nbsp; <br>
    <h2>Disproportionately Large Numbers of Talks Given by Small Numbers
      of Speakers</h2>
    A small fraction of speakers are responsible for a disproportionate
    number of talks.&nbsp; This is particularly dominant among female
    theorists.&nbsp; Pie Chart:
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    About 40% of talks are given by people with 3 or more talks.<br>

    <h2>Problematic Fluctuations in Gender Representation In Conference
      Speakers</h2>
    The fields of physics in general and nuclear physics has
    underrepresentation by women and minority much smaller than
    demographic fractions.&nbsp; [citation]&nbsp; Most in the community
    agree that steps should be taken to mitigate biases that contribute
    to the causes of underrepresentation and encourage the
    underepresented social identities to join and stay in the
    field.&nbsp; Research shows [citation stereotype threat, etc.] and
    experience of the RHIC Diversity Working group members&nbsp;
    anecdotally confirms that observing more role models in the
    field helps avoid negative feedback cycles that lead to further,
    worse underrepresentation.&nbsp; Talks at conferences are high
    profile situtations that&nbsp; conference organizers should
    therefore take steps to avoid unneccessary low fluctuations below
    the known fractions based on the demographic fractions of
    minorities.<br>
    <br>
    The results of Gender representation at major conferences has been
    uneven, with women frequently underrepresented among speakers <br>
    Women are less likely to get “vision” talks. No woman has ever given
    the QM summary. <br>
